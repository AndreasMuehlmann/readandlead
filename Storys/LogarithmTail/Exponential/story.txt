The logartihm goes to the house of the exponential function 2^x,
it is his relative. But 2^x doesn't like the idea of trying
to find out if tails ever end and just says that he doesn't
know and doesn't want to know. The logartihm thinks to
himself: "This old douche, he doesn't know anything. He
is probably mad, because his tail is so high up, he can't
see it behind the clouds". Then -2x^2 + 20 comes along, so
the logartihm with base two asks her, what he should.
-2x^2 + 20 suggests to walk up that hill so the young
logarithm could see for himself if his tail is infinit.

Are you going to follow the Lady's advice?
