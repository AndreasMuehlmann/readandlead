While the logartihm is hiking up the hill it starts to rain,
so he starts running. This instantly leads to him
tripping and hurting his knees. Eitherway the Logartihm goes on.
He really wants to see if his tail is infinit. Close 
to the top the young logarithm notices a lonely tree. In
the next moment a lighting strikes causing the tree to burn.
The logartihm is so scared he runs all the way home without looking
back and without ever coming back...
