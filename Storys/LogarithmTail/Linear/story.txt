The logartihm takes his bike and rides to the linear function x. 
It is really old and lives lonely in a house on a mountain.
When the young logarithm finally finds x, x is harvesting his fields,
but is happy to see the logarithm with the base two, he so young
and full of curiosity. When the logartihm asks his question
x just gives him a cup of tea and tells him: "Isn't it
great to not know, then anything is possible.". The young
logarithm doesn't quite get what x means, but trusts, that
what x said makes. Then he helps x with harvesting and emptys his
cup of tea.
